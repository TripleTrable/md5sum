# md5sum
md5sum ([RFC1321](rfc1321.txt)) in Haskell
This is part of a TH-Rosenheim module. The counterpart is located at https://github.com/TripleTrable/md5sum-go.git

## Install

To build use: 

```bash
$ cabal build
```
And to test run you can use:

```bash
$ cabal run -- <args>
```

To install use:

```bash
$ cabal install
```

## Unit tests

To run unit tests run:
```bash
$ cabal test
```

## Usage

The usage is the same as for the common GNU md5sum version with some exceptions.

Currently, the only working flag is ```-c``` as the ```--text``` and
```--binary``` flags are not used on Unix systems.

###Example:

Get MD5 hash from the file ```foo.bar```
```bash
$ md5sum foo.bar
dd32876efbff8edb1a41f81b9b0fc57b  foo.bar
```
Use md5 file to check a list of files

```bash
$ md5sum -c foo.md5
foo.bar: OK
```
    
## Inner workings

### MD5 algorithm overview
![md5sum Algorithm Overview (from geeksforgeeks)](./images/md5algo1.jpg)
As seen from the above image, the md5 algorithm iterates over the message in 512
bit chunks. Each chunk is then processed in a so-called round before beeing used
again with a new chunk.

### MD5 algorithm round calcuation
![md5sum Algorithm of one round (from Wikipedia)](./images/md5algo.svg)
The Algorithm uses 4 functions which are used on different rounds shown as
```F``` inside the above diagram. After Adding the result of ```F``` onto Block
```A```, the i'th part of the message chunk (```M_i```) as well as the constant
```K_i``` are added to the ```A``` block as well. After the addition the
resulting Block a is shuffeled by a constant each round. Now Block ```B``` is
added onto Block ```A``` and the resulting 4 Blocks are rotated.
*Note: All blocks are 32bit large, and the addition is Mod 2^32*
